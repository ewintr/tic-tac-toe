# Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe that runs in the terminal.

For information about this game, check [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).

Run the game with:

```bash
go run .
```

It uses [escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) to clear the screen after each turn. If this is not supported by your terminal, or if you just don't like them, use the following command to run the game without them:

```bash
go run . plain
```
